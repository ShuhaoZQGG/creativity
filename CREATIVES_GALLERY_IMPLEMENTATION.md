      total: number,
      page: number,
      limit: number,
      totalPages: number
    }
  }
  ```

#### New DELETE `/api/creatives/:id` Endpoint
- Delete a specific creative by ID
- Validates user ownership before deletion
- Returns success message on completion

### 4. Navigation Updates

  - Updated "View All" button to link to `/creatives` instead of `/generate`

## Technical Details

### API Query Parameters

```
GET /api/creatives?page=1&limit=20&search=nike&sortBy=createdAt&sortOrder=desc&startDate=2024-01-01&endDate=2024-12-31
```

### Database Schema
Uses existing Prisma schema for Creative model:
- `id`, `userId`, `inputContext`, `textVariant`
- `imageUrls`, `videoUrls`, `score`
- `createdAt`, `updatedAt`

### TypeScript Interfaces

```typescript
interface Creative {
  id: string;
  textVariant: {
    headline: string;
    body: string;
    cta: string;
  };
  imageUrls: string[];
  videoUrls?: string[];
  score: {
    overall: number;
  };
  inputContext: {
    brand_name: string;
  };
  createdAt: string;
  ctr?: number | null;
  spend?: number | null;
}
```

## User Experience

### Workflow
1. User navigates to Creatives page from sidebar
2. Sees all their creatives in a grid layout
3. Can search by keyword
4. Can sort by date or score
5. Can filter by date range (future enhancement)
6. Can click on creatives to view details
7. Can hover over creatives to access actions:
   - Download: Downloads the image file
   - Duplicate: Creates a copy (TODO)
   - Delete: Removes the creative after confirmation
8. Can paginate through multiple pages of creatives

### Responsive Design
- Mobile: 1 column
- Tablet: 2 columns
- Desktop: 3 columns
- Large Desktop: 4 columns

## Performance Considerations

1. **Pagination**: Default 20 items per page to reduce load times
2. **Signed URLs**: Images use pre-signed S3 URLs for security
3. **Lazy Loading**: Only loads current page of creatives
4. **Debouncing**: Search queries could benefit from debouncing (future enhancement)

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

1. **Bulk Actions**: Select multiple creatives for bulk operations
2. **Grid/List View Toggle**: Switch between grid and list layouts
3. **Duplicate Functionality**: Clone an existing creative
4. **Edit Creative**: Inline editing of headline, body, CTA
5. **Export Creatives**: Download multiple creatives as ZIP
6. **Performance Metrics**: Show CTR, conversions when Meta Ads integration is complete
7. **Status Filter**: Filter by draft, active, archived status
8. **Campaign Filter**: Filter by associated campaign
