## Permissions to Request

### Required Permissions for Your App

Go to: **App Review** > **Permissions and Features**

Request these three permissions:

#### 1. ads_management
**Use Case:**
```
We use ads_management to create and manage Facebook ad campaigns on behalf
of our users. Users can create A/B tests with multiple ad variants, and our
app creates campaigns, ad sets, and ads using the Marketing API.
```

#### 2. ads_read
**Use Case:**
```
We use ads_read to retrieve campaign performance data and display analytics
to users. This allows users to see campaign metrics like impressions, clicks,
CTR, and CPC.
```

#### 3. business_management
**Use Case:**
```
We use business_management to access the user's ad accounts. This is required
to create campaigns in the correct ad account and ensure proper business
context.
```
