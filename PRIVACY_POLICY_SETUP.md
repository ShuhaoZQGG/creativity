## Customization Needed

Before deploying, customize these sections:

### 1. Contact Emails

Update these placeholder emails in both `privacy/page.tsx` and `terms/page.tsx`:

**Current (placeholders):**
- `privacy@creativity-app.com`
- `support@creativity-app.com`
- `legal@creativity-app.com`

**Change to your real emails:**
```tsx
// In frontend/app/privacy/page.tsx (line ~429)
<a href="mailto:YOUR-EMAIL@YOUR-DOMAIN.com">
  YOUR-EMAIL@YOUR-DOMAIN.com
</a>

// In frontend/app/terms/page.tsx (similar location)
<a href="mailto:YOUR-EMAIL@YOUR-DOMAIN.com">
  YOUR-EMAIL@YOUR-DOMAIN.com
</a>
```

### 2. Jurisdiction (Terms of Service)

Update the governing law section in `terms/page.tsx`:

**Current:**
```tsx
These Terms are governed by the laws of [Your Jurisdiction].
```

**Change to:**
```tsx
These Terms are governed by the laws of Delaware, United States.
// Or your actual jurisdiction
```

### 3. Company Name (Optional)

If you want to use your actual company name instead of "Creativity":

**Find and replace in both files:**
- Search for: `"Creativity"` or `Creativity`
- Replace with: `Your Company Name, Inc.`

## Testing the Privacy Policy

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000/privacy
```

### Test After Deployment
```bash
# Visit your deployed URL
curl https://your-app.vercel.app/privacy
# Should return HTML (not an error)
```

### Verify Meta Can Access It
1. Open your privacy policy URL in incognito mode
2. Should be accessible without login
3. Should display full content
4. Should be mobile-responsive

## Common Issues

### Issue: 404 Error on /privacy

**Cause:** Next.js routing not set up correctly

**Solution:**
- Make sure file is at `frontend/app/privacy/page.tsx` (not `pages/privacy.tsx`)
- Using Next.js 13+ App Router
- Restart dev server after creating the file

### Issue: Meta says "Invalid Privacy Policy URL"

**Possible causes:**
- URL is not publicly accessible (requires login)
- URL returns 404 or error
- URL is localhost (must be deployed)
- HTTPS not enabled

**Solution:**
- Deploy to Vercel/Netlify (they provide HTTPS automatically)
- Test URL in incognito mode
- Make sure it's accessible without authentication

### Issue: Privacy Policy looks broken/unstyled

**Cause:** Missing Tailwind CSS or component library

**Solution:**
- Make sure you have `@/components/ui/button` and `@/components/ui/card` installed
- These should already exist in your project
- If not, check your Tailwind and shadcn/ui setup

## Alternative: Host Privacy Policy Elsewhere

If you prefer not to host on your app:

### Option 1: GitHub Pages
1. Create a simple HTML file from `PRIVACY_POLICY.md`
2. Host on GitHub Pages (free)
